# Drug Prediction using Decision Trees

This project demonstrates the development of a classification model using the Decision Tree algorithm to predict drug types based on various features.

## Project Structure

- `Drug-Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `drug200.csv`: Dataset containing the features and drug types used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pydotplus

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/drug-prediction.git
    cd drug-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn pydotplus
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Drug-Prediction.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset and perform data preprocessing.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train the Decision Tree model using the training set.
4. Evaluate the model's accuracy using the testing set.
5. Visualize the Decision Tree.
